# GamestonkTerminal ðŸš€

## About

Gamestonk Terminal is an awesome stock market terminal that has been developed for fun, while I saw my GME shares tanking. But hey, I like the stock ðŸ’ŽðŸ™Œ.

The implementation (in python) allows to easily add more commands, and expand on their configuration.

Feel free to request features, I'll be happy to work on them on my spare time.
