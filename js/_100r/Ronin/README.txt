RONIN

---------------

Ronin is a procedural graphics tool designed to automate simple graphical tasks, like resizing, cropping, coloring, and generating algorithmic images. It interprets a minimal dialect of LISP, look at the examples to better understand how this all works.

The library updates is constantly revealing new applications to Ronin, you can see the list of available functions here. Most of our iconography and designs were created with both Ronin and Dotgrid.

Helpers

Ronin helpers are keywords that facilitates adding coordinates from the canvas into your script. The currently supported helpers are $rect, $pos, $line, $circle & $arc. Holding right-click while using a $helper will run the script as the mouse is injecting coordinates into the script. Paste the following script, and trace a shape in the canvas:

(fill $circle "red")

Additional helpers are also available to change parts of a shape, these are as follow: $x, $y, $xy, $wh, $a & $r. Paste the following script, and change the position and radius of a circle:

(clear)
(fill 
  (circle $xy $r) "red")

Extra helpers are available for various transformations, these are as follow: $drag, $view, $poly, $move & $rotate. Paste the following script, and draw the vertices of a line, press escape to stop:

(clear)
(stroke 
  $poly "red")

Import/Export

To save an image in memory, open an image file with Ronin, or drag an image file on the window. You will then be able to import it by using the file image's name. If the image file is `preview.png`, you can import it as follow:

(import $path 
  (pos 100 100))

(import "preview.jpg" 
  (rect 100 100 400 400))

(export)
